Problem 4.1 k-means vs. Spectral Clustering
In this problem we will use a circle-shaped dataset and a spiral-shaped dataset. Figure 1 shows examples
for circle and spiral shaped datasets with 2 clusters. These synthetic examples can be generated using the
provided functions sample circle.m and sample spiral.m.

Problem 4.2 Spectral Clustering on Airbnb data
In this problem we will use a newly released real-world dataset obtained from
http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html
It consists of n = 2558 houses listed on the Airbnb website in the Boston area in Oct. 2015. We have
pre-processed the data into a MATLAB file “BostonListing.mat”. For each listing, we will keep its
latitude, longitude, and neighborhood. The “neighborhood” attribute indicates the region of each house
listing such as “allston”, “brighton”, etc. We will use latitude and longitude as a 2-D feature vector for each
listing and treat neighborhood as the ground-truth cluster label. Our goal is to cluster the listings into clus-
ters that can reflect the neighborhood structure based on latitude and longitude. Figure 2 is a visualization
of this dataset on Google Map.

Problem 2.1 San Francisco Crime Prediction: (∼1–2hrs run time)
In this problem we will work with a recent real-world dataset that can be downloaded from the following
website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime. This dataset is hosted by Kaggle as part of a competi-
tion for the machine learning community to use for fun and practice. The competition started at 8:51 pm on
Tuesday 2 June 2015 UTC and ends at 11:59 pm, Monday 6 June 2016 UTC (370 total days). The dataset
contains information about various incidents ranging from January 2003 to March 2015 derived from the
San Francisco Police Department Crime Incident Reporting system. The raw data has been pre-processed
into two MATLAB .mat files: data SFcrime train.mat and data SFcrime test.mat. Each incident
contains the following attributes:

Problem 2.2 SVM Classifier for Text Documents: (∼1–2hrs run time)
In this problem we will use SVMs to classify documents in the 20 Newsgroup dataset which we have en-
countered before in Matlab Exercise 1.2. The dataset provided in data 20news.zip contains the following
files

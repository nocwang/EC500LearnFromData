Matlab Exercise 1

Problem 1.1 Gaussian Discriminant Analysis:
In this problem we consider using various Gaussian Discriminant Analysis classifiers.

Problem 1.2 Naive Bayes Text Document Classifiers: In this problem we classify text documents using
Naive Bayes. We use the classic 20 newsgroup dataset. Here, each document is labeled as one of 20 different
classes and is provided in data 20news.zip. This directory contains the following files:
1. vocabulary.txt: a list of all the words that can possibly appear in the documents. The line number
of a word is its ID (Word ID).
2. newsgrouplabels.txt: the names of the 20 classes. The line number of a class (label) is its ID.
3. train.data and test.data: the words in each of the documents. Each line of each file is of the
form: “Document ID, Word ID, Word count”. Word count is the number of times word Word ID
appears in document Document ID.
4. train.label and test.label: the labels of the training and testing documents.
5. stoplist.txt: a list of so-called “stop words” such as “the”, “is”, “on”, etc. This will be used only
in part (f).

Problem 1.3 Nearest Neighbor Classifier: In this problem we will apply a k- Nearest Neighbor classi-
fier based on the Euclidean distance to two datasets. First, we consider a simulated data set provided in
data knnSimulation.mat. The rows of variable Xtrain are data points and each data point has 2 feature
attributes.
